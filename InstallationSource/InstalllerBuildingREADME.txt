I built the installer using NSIS, a free scripting language for creating custom installers.

Note these installers are setup for my laptop, therefore need editting before running on your computer.
All the source code is here, I woud recommend making a new custom installer for each build. 
NSIS is well documented and you need to download a complier for it. 

I have included more detailed instructions on the MPAi wiki.
