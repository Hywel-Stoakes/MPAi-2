## Installation Notes
The installer is too large to be committed to the repository. To get the install files, head to the YsqEvilmax fork of MPAid, and download release 1.6. This is a temporary fix, a subsequent release will have the install files on this fork.

## Usage

### Speak
Speak focuses in on pronuncing Maori words correctly. Via a speech recognision program, which has a build in scoring system. This scoring system maintains a history of all the users speech scores, and can be viewed at any time. As well as an advanced audio player.

### Sound
Sound is about pronuncing the vowels, This is done through a video player which allows for the user to hear as well as see the wvowels being said. Through a formant plot the user can pracitice the whole Maori vowel space. There is also a Vowel target, which allows the user to test against a particular vowel. The vowel plot comes with a builtin scoring system, which is maintained for a particular user on a particular computer.
