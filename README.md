Sound is about pronuncing the vowels, This is done through a video player which allows for the user to hear as well as see the wvowels being said. Through a formant plot the user can pracitice the whole Maori vowel space. There is also a Vowel target, which allows the user to test against a particular vowel. The vowel plot comes with a builtin scoring system, which is maintained for a particular user on a particular computer.
